# Regression
In this folder we have some Python code for regression.<br/>
Code linear.py create a linear model based on OLS and show a graph and summary.<br/>
Code polynomial.py create a polynomial model with graph and summary.<br/>
Code multiple_regression.py creates a model based on two variables and creates a summary and prediction based on data.csv.<br/>
Code standardisation.py uses the same data as the previously mentioned code multiple_regression, but the data is standardised.<br/>
The project uses the pandas, numpy, statsmodels and sklearn modules. <br/>
The Ward and Furthest Neighbour (Najdalszego sasiada) folders are also located here. These contain codes that produce dendrograms based on excel data. In addition, they indicate which variables are most relevant using the Clusters method
