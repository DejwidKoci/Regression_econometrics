# Regression
In this folder we have some python codes about regression. <br/>
Code linear.py create linear model based on OLS and shows a plot and summary. <br/>
Code polynomian.py create polynomian model with a plot and summary. <br/>
Code multiple_regression.py create model based on two varables and create summary and prediction based on data.csv. <br/>
Code standarisation.py uses the same data like aforementioned code multiple_regression but the data are standarised. <br/>
In this project is used pandas, numpy, statsmodels and sklearn modules. <br/>
